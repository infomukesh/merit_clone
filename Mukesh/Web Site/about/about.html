    <h1>About</h1>
    <p><p class="heading"> - EMERGING TECHNOLOGY</p>
        Our country is on the brink of a period of rapid changes. New knowledge learnt through IT enabled services is fast changing the shape of this planet. The wonderful thing is that the knowledge is self-generating. One new discovery leads to a chain reaction of new discoveries and knowledge.</p>
        
        <p>This millennium is an era of information and knowledge. For fast development, we as a nation have to convert ourselves into a society, which is knowledge centric. The IT has played a major role ushering in "Knowledge Revolution" from the earlier concept of 'Data Management', 'Management of Information' to 'Knowledge Management' today. </p>
        
        <p><p class="heading">MERIT</p>
        Considering the importance of Information Technology and its impact in changing our nation into a knowledge society, General Mohyal Sabha (GMS) established "Mohyal Educational & Research Institute of Technology" acronym as MERIT. </p>
        
        <p><p class="heading">VISION</p>
        Quality is the basis and Perfectionism is the ultimate goal in all our activities. Both are to be practiced on a continuous basis in a committed environment of teamwork that fosters innovation, leadership and expertise, as a result of value added education through self-learning process with hands-on training and online case studies. </p>
        
        <p><p class="heading">MISSION</p>
        To create an environment and facilities to mould the youth of the country into top-notch professionals, good citizens, and persons of character and integrity. It is proposed to achieve the above objectives through quality education using a judicious mix of gurukul system and state of the art learning technologies. The thrust is on the building of concepts and fundamentals. We believe, once this is clear rest just follows and leaders in the subject get created. The society would like to confine itself generally to the disciplines of new emerging technologies. </p>
        
        <p><p class="heading">MERIT is Meritorious Organization</p>
        
        With over 100 computers of the latest configurations, 5 fully air-conditioned labs, full power backup, and sufficient internet provisions, MERIT is one of the few institutions, which have such facilities of international standards. Becoming an online testing center for various international testing organizations like TOEFL, GRE, is proof of this. </p>
        
        <p>Contribution to Youth<br>
        
        Youth are the building blocks of society and this MERIT knew from the beginning. Thus, its core functions were planned keeping in mind the following youth-oriented aspects. </p>
        
        1) Education 2) Counseling 3) Employment<br>
        
        <p>Keeping in mind the requirements of different age groups, with different objectives and background, diverse courses have been launched in MERIT. It has become a study center of IGNOU and Jamia Milia Islamia universities with various undergraduate and postgraduate courses. It has also become an authorized vocational training center of NCVT, Government of India.</p>
        
        <p>The Second challenge that the youth of today face is the uncertainty in choosing the right path for their career. Keeping this in mind, MERIT took active part in building youth forums and contributed immensely in managing youth camps, where teenagers received guidance and counseling from eminent academicians, scholars and industrialists.</p>
        
        <p>Most of the educated youth of this era feel helpless, when they face the problem of joblessness. This thus became the third front to be conquered by MERIT. i.e., to infuse employable skills and generate employment opportunities for the educated youth. MERIT has played a vital role in this arena by introducing government- approved job-oriented courses. It gives us immense pleasure and satisfaction to declare success of MERIT in this regard. Various job-oriented and vocational training programs conducted by MERIT have benefitted a large number of young professionals; the same is depicted by the number of students getting jobs. A high percentage of COPA and NIELIT students of MERIT have been placed in good organizations. A few of the students have also been given the opportunity to work at MERIT itself. </p>
